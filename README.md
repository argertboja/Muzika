# Muzika

## Description
We developed a web application Named Muzika which can be considered as a musing 
sharing social network  as it  provides the users  with different activities  performed in social 
networks.  Users  have  different  access  rights  in  the  app  as  they  can  sign  up  as  customers, 
artists  or  managers  (representing  a  label).  They  can  use  the  app  for  free,  however  the 
consumer has to purchase  songs in order to listen to them.  Users may log in or sign up by 
providing the relevant information in the required fields.  Customers have to pay in order to 
purchase songs and artist need to pay when publishing songs as well. The customer can create 
and  share  playlists  with  songs  from  several  artists,  follow  artists,  connect  with  other 
consumers, share songs (and comments) with his/her connections.  He/she  can buy multiple 
songs  from  many  artists  if  the  credit  left  is  sufficient.  However,  the  sharing  process  with 
other  consumers only reveals the titles of the songs the consumer  is listening to. In order for 
the other  consumers  to listen  to a song they have to buy it.  Furthermore,  all  the shares of a 
particular consumer  are shown in his wall when his profile is visited.  Other consumers can 
comment on those shared items.
